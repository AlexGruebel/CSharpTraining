1. Acces Modifiers:
	-public Member is accesible everywhere
	-private & default Member ist accesible inside the type only
	-protected is accesible inside the type and that inherits from the type
	-internal Member ist accesible inside the type and in the same assembly
	-internal protected combination of interenal & protected

2. Difference between static, const, readonly:
	-static is bind on the class not the object, if a static field changes it will have the same 		 value on all objects
	
	-if a field is defined as const, it cannot be changed
	-if the source code gets compiled its just a literal
	
	-readonly field can be assigend once, and cant be changed afterwards
	-readonly fields wont be just literals if the code gets compiled
	
3. Constructor:
	-the Construcot executed, when the object is created
	-most of the time the constructer is used to assign values to fields

4. [Flag] Attribut
	-it s used on the enum to change which typ its indexes
	-for example byte

4. partial
	-its used to funktionality to a class in a another file

6. tupel:
	-you can store multiple values in a tuple
	-you can index it 
	-you can define thoses indexes
	-moust of the time its used to return multiple values from a method

7. ref:
   -its define a reference

8. overloading:
	-when you make a copy of a method and change the signatur

9. the differnce between a field and a property
	-a property is accesible outside the class
	-it can execute actions when the property is changed
	-a field is variable in the class
	-propertys are also fields

10. method parameters are optional, when they have a default value
